# AutoPTT

[AutoPTT](https://wibe.gumroad.com/l/autoptt) is a Windows application that presses and releases your push-to-talk key based on voice activity.

**This repo is issue tracking and documentation only.**

## Download

**[Latest release](https://soupbawx.com/AutoPTT.zip)**

**[Archive of all releases](https://soupbawx.com/AutoPTT/?sort=time&order=desc)**

If you run it and get an error that mentions a missing DLL, you should install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

There is also a hand-written **[change log](CHANGELOG.md)**, in case you're curious about what's new in each release.

## License

This is commercial software that you'll need a license to run.

You can buy a license through [Gumroad](https://wibe.gumroad.com/l/autoptt). It's a one-time purchase, valid forever, for all future updates.

I might add a proper trial version later.

## Contact

If you need help, found a bug, have a feature request or anything else you think I might want to know about, you can open an issue here on Github or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/NHVsGZY3dF).
