**[Archive of all releases](https://soupbawx.com/AutoPTT/?sort=time&order=desc)**

If you run it and get an error that mentions a missing DLL, you should install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

There is also a hand-written **[change log](CHANGELOG.md)**, in case you're curious about what's new in each release.

## License

You can buy a license through [Gumroad](https://wibe.gumroad.com/l/autoptt). It's a one-time purchase, valid forever, for all future updates.

You may use the app without a license, too, but only for 5 minutes. After that, you'll need to restart it, and then you can use it for another 5 minutes if you like. 

For uninterrupted use, though, you'll need a license.
